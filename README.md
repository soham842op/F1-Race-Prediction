# F1 Race Prediction Analysis

A data science project to predict Formula 1 race outcomes using FastF1 API and machine learning models.

## Features
- Data extraction from FastF1 API
- Analysis of lap times, tire performance, and weather conditions
- Predictive modeling for race outcomes
- Visualization dashboard using Streamlit



## Day 1: Data Extraction & Exploration

### Accomplished Today:
- Set up the FastF1 API environment with local cache
- Successfully extracted detailed F1 race data from the China GP
- Identified key performance metrics for analysis:
  - Lap times and position tracking
  - Sector breakdowns (Sector1, Sector2, Sector3)
  - Tire compound information and tire life tracking
  - Speed trap data (SpeedI1, SpeedI2, SpeedFL, SpeedST)
  - Track conditions and driver performance indicators
